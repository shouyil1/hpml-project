It seems like you're encountering a series of "command not found" errors in your bash shell. This typically happens when the shell is trying to execute lines that are not valid commands or scripts. Let's break down the issue and find a solution.

### Step 1: Understand the Error

The errors indicate that the shell is interpreting each line as a separate command, which is incorrect. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. **Incorrect Script Format**: The script might be missing shebang (`#!/bin/bash`) at the top, or it might be formatted incorrectly.
2. **Environment Issues**: There might be issues with the environment variables or the shell configuration.
3. **File Permissions**: The file might not have executable permissions.

### Step 2: Check the Script

Let's assume you have a script named `script.sh`. Here’s how you can check and fix it:

1. **Add Shebang**: Ensure the script starts with `#!/bin/bash`.
2. **Check for Syntax Errors**: Make sure there are no syntax errors in the script.
3. **Set Executable Permissions**: Ensure the script has executable permissions.

### Step 3: Fix the Script

Here’s an example of how you can fix the script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script commands here
echo "Hello, World!"
```

### Step 4: Set Executable Permissions

Run the following command to set the executable permissions for the script:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

### Step 5: Run the Script

Now, try running the script:

### Step 6: Verify the Output

If everything is correct, you should see the output of your script. If you still encounter errors, please provide more details about the script and the environment.

### Additional Tips

- **Check for Hidden Characters**: Sometimes, hidden characters (like carriage returns) can cause issues. You can use `cat -v` to view hidden characters in the script.
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure that all necessary environment variables are set correctly.
- **Shell Configuration**: Check your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` for any configurations that might be affecting the script execution.

If you provide more details about the script and the environment, I can offer more specific advice.

The error message "bash: ./script.sh: No such file or directory" indicates that the shell cannot find the file `script.sh` in the current directory. This could be due to several reasons:

1. **File Does Not Exist**: The file `script.sh` might not be present in the directory where you are trying to run it.
2. **Typographical Error**: There might be a typo in the filename.
3. **Directory Issue**: You might be in the wrong directory.

Let's go through the steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue.

### Step 1: Verify the File Exists

First, check if the file `script.sh` exists in the current directory:

```bash
ls -l
```

This command will list all files in the current directory along with their details. Look for `script.sh` in the output.

### Step 2: Check the Current Directory

Ensure you are in the correct directory where `script.sh` is located. You can print the current directory using:

```bash
pwd
```

If you are not in the correct directory, navigate to the correct one using:

```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path where `script.sh` is located.

### Step 3: Verify the Filename

Double-check the filename for any typos. Filenames are case-sensitive, so ensure the case matches exactly.

### Step 4: Create the File if Missing

If the file does not exist, you can create it using a text editor. For example, using `nano`:

```bash
nano script.sh
```

Add the following content to the file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script commands here
echo "Hello, World!"
```

Save the file and exit the editor (in `nano`, press `CTRL+X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).

### Step 5: Set Executable Permissions

Make sure the script has executable permissions:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

### Step 6: Run the Script

Now, try running the script again:

### Additional Tips

- **Hidden Files**: If `script.sh` is a hidden file (i.e., it starts with a dot), you can list hidden files using:

  ```bash
  ls -la
  ```

- **Alternative Paths**: If you know the full path to `script.sh`, you can run it directly using the full path:

  ```bash
  /full/path/to/script.sh
  ```

If you follow these steps and still encounter issues, please provide more details about your environment and the exact commands you are running.

Given the observation that `bash: ./script.sh: No such file or directory`, it seems like the file `script.sh` is indeed not found in the current directory. Let's go through a step-by-step process to diagnose and resolve this issue.

### Step 1: Verify the Current Directory

First, confirm the current working directory by running:

```bash
pwd
```

This command will display the absolute path of the directory you are currently in.

### Step 2: List Files in the Current Directory

Next, list all files in the current directory to see if `script.sh` is present:

```bash
ls -la
```

The `-l` option provides a detailed listing, and the `-a` option includes hidden files (those starting with a dot). Look for `script.sh` in the output.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Correct Directory

If `script.sh` is not in the current directory, you need to navigate to the directory where it resides. Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:

```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path where `script.sh` is located.

### Step 4: Verify the Filename

Ensure that the filename is spelled correctly and matches the case. Filenames are case-sensitive in Unix-like systems.

### Step 5: Create the Script if Missing

If `script.sh` does not exist, you can create it. Open a text editor like `nano`:

```bash
nano script.sh
```

Add the following content to the file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script commands here
echo "Hello, World!"
```

Save the file and exit the editor (in `nano`, press `CTRL+X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).

### Step 6: Set Executable Permissions

Make sure the script has executable permissions:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

### Step 7: Run the Script

Now, try running the script again:

### Additional Tips

- **Hidden Files**: If `script.sh` is a hidden file (i.e., it starts with a dot), you can list hidden files using:

  ```bash
  ls -la
  ```

- **Alternative Paths**: If you know the full path to `script.sh`, you can run it directly using the full path:

  ```bash
  /full/path/to/script.sh
  ```

- **Check for Typos**: Double-check the filename for any typos, including spaces or special characters.

If you follow these steps and still encounter issues, please provide more details about your environment and the exact commands you are running.

Given the observation that `bash: ./script.sh: No such file or directory`, it seems like the file `script.sh` is indeed not found in the current directory. Let's go through a step-by-step process to diagnose and resolve this issue.

### Step 1: Verify the Current Directory

First, confirm the current working directory by running:

```bash

This command will display the absolute path of the directory you are currently in.

### Step 2: List Files in the Current Directory

Next, list all files in the current directory to see if `script.sh` is present:

```bash
ls -la
```

The `-l` option provides a detailed listing, and the `-a` option includes hidden files (those starting with a dot). Look for `script.sh` in the output.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Correct Directory

If `script.sh` is not in the current directory, you need to navigate to the directory where it resides. Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:

```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path where `script.sh` is located.

### Step 4: Verify the Filename

Ensure that the filename is spelled correctly and matches the case. Filenames are case-sensitive in Unix-like systems.

### Step 5: Create the Script if Missing

If `script.sh` does not exist, you can create it. Open a text editor like `nano`:

```bash

Add the following content to the file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script commands here
echo "Hello, World!"
```

Save the file and exit the editor (in `nano`, press `CTRL+X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).

### Step 6: Set Executable Permissions

Make sure the script has executable permissions:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

### Step 7: Run the Script

Now, try running the script again:

### Additional Tips

- **Hidden Files**: If `script.sh` is a hidden file (i.e., it starts with a dot), you can list hidden files using:

  ```bash
  ls -la
  ```

- **Alternative Paths**: If you know the full path to `script.sh`, you can run it directly using the full path:

  ```bash
  /full/path/to/script.sh
  ```

- **Check for Typos**: Double-check the filename for any typos, including spaces or special characters.

If you follow these steps and still encounter issues, please provide more details about your environment and the exact commands you are running.

### Step 2: List Files in the Current Directory

Next, list all files in the current directory to see if `script.sh` is present:

```bash
ls -la
```

The `-l` option provides a detailed listing, and the `-a` option includes hidden files (those starting with a dot). Look for `script.sh` in the output.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Correct Directory

If `script.sh` is not in the current directory, you need to navigate to the directory where it resides. Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:

```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path where `script.sh` is located.

### Step 4: Verify the Filename

Ensure that the filename is spelled correctly and matches the case. Filenames are case-sensitive in Unix-like systems.

### Step 5: Create the Script if Missing

If `script.sh` does not exist, you can create it. Open a text editor like `nano`:

```bash
nano script.sh
```

Add the following content to the file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script commands here
echo "Hello, World!"
```

Save the file and exit the editor (in `nano`, press `CTRL+X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).

### Step 6: Set Executable Permissions

Make sure the script has executable permissions:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

### Step 7: Run the Script

Now, try running the script again:

### Additional Tips

- **Hidden Files**: If `script.sh` is a hidden file (i.e., it starts with a dot), you can list hidden files using:

  ```bash
  ls -la
  ```

- **Alternative Paths**: If you know the full path to `script.sh`, you can run it directly using the full path:

  ```bash
  /full/path/to/script.sh
  ```

- **Check for Typos**: Double-check the filename for any typos, including spaces or special characters.

If you follow these steps and still encounter issues, please provide more details about your environment and the exact commands you are running.

Given the observation that `bash: ./script.sh: No such file or directory`, it seems like the file `script.sh` is indeed not found in the current directory. Let's go through a step-by-step process to diagnose and resolve this issue.

### Step 1: Verify the Current Directory

First, confirm the current working directory by running:

```bash
pwd
```

This command will display the absolute path of the directory you are currently in.

### Step 2: List Files in the Current Directory

Next, list all files in the current directory to see if `script.sh` is present:

```bash
ls -la
```

The `-l` option provides a detailed listing, and the `-a` option includes hidden files (those starting with a dot). Look for `script.sh` in the output.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Correct Directory

If `script.sh` is not in the current directory, you need to navigate to the directory where it resides. Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:

```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path where `script.sh` is located.

### Step 4: Verify the Filename

Ensure that the filename is spelled correctly and matches the case. Filenames are case-sensitive in Unix-like systems.

### Step 5: Create the Script if Missing

If `script.sh` does not exist, you can create it. Open a text editor like `nano`:

```bash
nano script.sh
```

Add the following content to the file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script commands here
echo "Hello, World!"
```

Save the file and exit the editor (in `nano`, press `CTRL+X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).

### Step 6: Set Executable Permissions

Make sure the script has executable permissions:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

### Step 7: Run the Script

Now, try running the script again:

### Additional Tips

- **Hidden Files**: If `script.sh` is a hidden file (i.e., it starts with a dot), you can list hidden files using:

  ```bash
  ls -la
  ```

- **Alternative Paths**: If you know the full path to `script.sh`, you can run it directly using the full path:

  ```bash

  ```

- **Check for Typos**: Double-check the filename for any typos, including spaces or special characters.

Given the observation that `bash: ./script.sh: No such file or directory`, it seems like the file `script.sh` is indeed not found in the current directory. Let's go through a step-by-step process to diagnose and resolve this issue.

### Step 1: Verify the Current Directory

First, confirm the current working directory by running:

```bash
pwd
```

This command will display the absolute path of the directory you are currently in.

### Step 2: List Files in the Current Directory

Next, list all files in the current directory to see if `script.sh` is present:

```bash
ls -la
```

The `-l` option provides a detailed listing, and the `-a` option includes hidden files (those starting with a dot). Look for `script.sh` in the output.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Correct Directory

If `script.sh` is not in the current directory, you need to navigate to the directory where it resides. Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:

```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path where `script.sh` is located.

### Step 4: Verify the Filename

Ensure that the filename is spelled correctly and matches the case. Filenames are case-sensitive in Unix-like systems.

### Step 5: Create the Script if Missing

If `script.sh` does not exist, you can create it. Open a text editor like `nano`:

```bash
nano script.sh
```

Add the following content to the file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script commands here
echo "Hello, World!"
```

Save the file and exit the editor (in `nano`, press `CTRL+X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).

### Step 6: Set Executable Permissions

Make sure the script has executable permissions:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

### Step 7: Run the Script

Now, try running the script again:

### Additional Tips

- **Hidden Files**: If `script.sh` is a hidden file (i.e., it starts with a dot), you can list hidden files using:

  ```bash
  ls -la
  ```

- **Alternative Paths**: If you know the full path to `script.sh`, you can run it directly using the full path:

  ```bash
  /full/path/to/script.sh
  ```

- **Check for Typos**: Double-check the filename for any typos, including spaces or special characters.

If you follow these steps and still encounter issues, please provide more details about your environment and the exact commands you are running.

First, confirm the current working directory by running:

```bash
pwd
```

This command will display the absolute path of the directory you are currently in.

### Step 2: List Files in the Current Directory

Next, list all files in the current directory to see if `script.sh` is present:

```bash
ls -la
```

The `-l` option provides a detailed listing, and the `-a` option includes hidden files (those starting with a dot). Look for `script.sh` in the output.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Correct Directory

If `script.sh` is not in the current directory, you need to navigate to the directory where it resides. Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:

```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path where `script.sh` is located.

### Step 4: Verify the Filename

Ensure that the filename is spelled correctly and matches the case. Filenames are case-sensitive in Unix-like systems.

### Step 5: Create the Script if Missing

If `script.sh` does not exist, you can create it. Open a text editor like `nano`:

```bash
nano script.sh
```

Add the following content to the file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script commands here
echo "Hello, World!"
```

Save the file and exit the editor (in `nano`, press `CTRL+X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).

### Step 6: Set Executable Permissions

Make sure the script has executable permissions:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

### Step 7: Run the Script

Now, try running the script again:

### Additional Tips

- **Hidden Files**: If `script.sh` is a hidden file (i.e., it starts with a dot), you can list hidden files using:

  ```bash
  ls -la
  ```

- **Alternative Paths**: If you know the full path to `script.sh`, you can run it directly using the full path:

  ```bash
  /full/path/to/script.sh
  ```

- **Check for Typos**: Double-check the filename for any typos, including spaces or special characters.

If you follow these steps and still encounter issues, please provide more details about your environment and the exact commands you are running.

Given the observation that `bash: ./script.sh: No such file or directory`, it seems like the file `script.sh` is indeed not found in the current directory. Let's go through a step-by-step process to diagnose and resolve this issue.

### Step 1: Verify the Current Directory

First, confirm the current working directory by running:

```bash
pwd
```

This command will display the absolute path of the directory you are currently in.

### Step 2: List Files in the Current Directory

Next, list all files in the current directory to see if `script.sh` is present:

```bash
ls -la
```

The `-l` option provides a detailed listing, and the `-a` option includes hidden files (those starting with a dot). Look for `script.sh` in the output.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Correct Directory

If `script.sh` is not in the current directory, you need to navigate to the directory where it resides. Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:

```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path where `script.sh` is located.

### Step 4: Verify the Filename

Ensure that the filename is spelled correctly and matches the case. Filenames are case-sensitive in Unix-like systems.

### Step 5: Create the Script if Missing

If `script.sh` does not exist, you can create it. Open a text editor like `nano`:

```bash

Add the following content to the file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script commands here
echo "Hello, World!"
```

Save the file and exit the editor (in `nano`, press `CTRL+X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).

### Step 6: Set Executable Permissions

Make sure the script has executable permissions:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

### Step 7: Run the Script

Now, try running the script again:

### Additional Tips

- **Hidden Files**: If `script.sh` is a hidden file (i.e., it starts with a dot), you can list hidden files using:

  ```bash

- **Alternative Paths**: If you know the full path to `script.sh`, you can run it directly using the full path:

Given the observation that `bash: ./script.sh: No such file or directory`, it seems like the file `script.sh` is indeed not found in the current directory. Let's go through a step-by-step process to diagnose and resolve this issue.

### Step 1: Verify the Current Directory

First, confirm the current working directory by running:

```bash
pwd
```

This command will display the absolute path of the directory you are currently in.

### Step 2: List Files in the Current Directory

Next, list all files in the current directory to see if `script.sh` is present:

```bash
ls -la
```

The `-l` option provides a detailed listing, and the `-a` option includes hidden files (those starting with a dot). Look for `script.sh` in the output.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Correct Directory

If `script.sh` is not in the current directory, you need to navigate to the directory where it resides. Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:

```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path where `script.sh` is located.

### Step 4: Verify the Filename

Ensure that the filename is spelled correctly and matches the case. Filenames are case-sensitive in Unix-like systems.

### Step 5: Create the Script if Missing

If `script.sh` does not exist, you can create it. Open a text editor like `nano`:

```bash
nano script.sh
```

Add the following content to the file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script commands here
echo "Hello, World!"
```

Save the file and exit the editor (in `nano`, press `CTRL+X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).

### Step 6: Set Executable Permissions

Make sure the script has executable permissions:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

### Step 7: Run the Script

Now, try running the script again:

### Additional Tips

- **Hidden Files**: If `script.sh` is a hidden file (i.e., it starts with a dot), you can list hidden files using:

  ```bash
  ls -la
  ```

- **Alternative Paths**: If you know the full path to `script.sh`, you can run it directly using the full path:

  ```bash
  /full/path/to/script.sh
  ```

- **Check for Typos**: Double-check the filename for any typos, including spaces or special characters.

If you follow these steps and still encounter issues, please provide more details about your environment and the exact commands you are running.

```bash
pwd
```

This command will display the absolute path of the directory you are currently in.

### Step 2: List Files in the Current Directory

Next, list all files in the current directory to see if `script.sh` is present:

```bash
ls -la
```

The `-l` option provides a detailed listing, and the `-a` option includes hidden files (those starting with a dot). Look for `script.sh` in the output.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Correct Directory

If `script.sh` is not in the current directory, you need to navigate to the directory where it resides. Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:

```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path where `script.sh` is located.

### Step 4: Verify the Filename

Ensure that the filename is spelled correctly and matches the case. Filenames are case-sensitive in Unix-like systems.

### Step 5: Create the Script if Missing

If `script.sh` does not exist, you can create it. Open a text editor like `nano`:

```bash
nano script.sh
```

Add the following content to the file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script commands here
echo "Hello, World!"
```

Save the file and exit the editor (in `nano`, press `CTRL+X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).

### Step 6: Set Executable Permissions

Make sure the script has executable permissions:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

### Step 7: Run the Script

Now, try running the script again:

### Additional Tips

- **Hidden Files**: If `script.sh` is a hidden file (i.e., it starts with a dot), you can list hidden files using:

  ```bash
  ls -la
  ```

- **Alternative Paths**: If you know the full path to `script.sh`, you can run it directly using the full path:

  ```bash
  /full/path/to/script.sh
  ```

- **Check for Typos**: Double-check the filename for any typos, including spaces or special characters.

If you follow these steps and still encounter issues, please provide more details about your environment and the exact commands you are running.

Given the observation that `bash: ./script.sh: No such file or directory`, it seems like the file `script.sh` is indeed not found in the current directory. Let's go through a step-by-step process to diagnose and resolve this issue.

### Step 1: Verify the Current Directory

First, confirm the current working directory by running:

```bash
pwd
```

This command will display the absolute path of the directory you are currently in.

### Step 2: List Files in the Current Directory

Next, list all files in the current directory to see if `script.sh` is present:

```bash
ls -la
```

The `-l` option provides a detailed listing, and the `-a` option includes hidden files (those starting with a dot). Look for `script.sh` in the output.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Correct Directory

If `script.sh` is not in the current directory, you need to navigate to the directory where it resides. Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:

```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path where `script.sh` is located.

### Step 4: Verify the Filename

Ensure that the filename is spelled correctly and matches the case. Filenames are case-sensitive in Unix-like systems.

### Step 5: Create the Script if Missing

If `script.sh` does not exist, you can create it. Open a text editor like `nano`:

```bash
nano script.sh
```

Add the following content to the file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script commands here
echo "Hello, World!"
```

Save the file and exit the editor (in `nano`, press `CTRL+X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).

### Step 6: Set Executable Permissions

Make sure the script has executable permissions:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

### Step 7: Run the Script

Now, try running the script again:

### Additional Tips

- **Hidden Files**: If `script.sh` is a hidden file (i.e., it starts with a dot), you can list hidden files using:

  ```bash
  ls -la
  ```

- **Alternative Paths**: If you know the full path to `script.sh`, you can run it directly using the full path:

  ```bash
  /full/path/to/script.sh
  ```

- **Check for Typos**: Double-check the filename for any typos, including spaces or special characters.

If you follow these steps and still encounter issues, please provide more details about your environment and the exact commands you are running.

Given the observation that `bash: ./script.sh: No such file or directory`, it seems like the file `script.sh` is indeed not found in the current directory. Let's go through a step-by-step process to diagnose and resolve this issue.

### Step 1: Verify the Current Directory

First, confirm the current working directory by running:

```bash
pwd
```

This command will display the absolute path of the directory you are currently in.

### Step 2: List Files in the Current Directory

Next, list all files in the current directory to see if `script.sh` is present:

```bash
ls -la
```

The `-l` option provides a detailed listing, and the `-a` option includes hidden files (those starting with a dot). Look for `script.sh` in the output.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Correct Directory

If `script.sh` is not in the current directory, you need to navigate to the directory where it resides. Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:

```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path where `script.sh` is located.

### Step 4: Verify the Filename

Ensure that the filename is spelled correctly and matches the case. Filenames are case-sensitive in Unix-like systems.

### Step 5: Create the Script if Missing

If `script.sh` does not exist, you can create it. Open a text editor like `nano`:

```bash
nano script.sh
```

Add the following content to the file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script commands here
echo "Hello, World!"
```

Save the file and exit the editor (in `nano`, press `CTRL+X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).

### Step 6: Set Executable Permissions

Make sure the script has executable permissions:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

### Step 7: Run the Script

Now, try running the script again:

### Additional Tips

- **Hidden Files**: If `script.sh` is a hidden file (i.e., it starts with a dot), you can list hidden files using:

  ```bash
  ls -la
  ```

- **Alternative Paths**: If you know the full path to `script.sh`, you can run it directly using the full path:

  ```bash
  /full/path/to/script.sh
  ```

- **Check for Typos**: Double-check the filename for any typos, including spaces or special characters.

If you follow these steps and still encounter issues, please provide more details about your environment and the exact commands you are running.

First, confirm the current working directory by running:

```bash
pwd
```

This command will display the absolute path of the directory you are currently in.

### Step 2: List Files in the Current Directory

Next, list all files in the current directory to see if `script.sh` is present:

```bash
ls -la
```

The `-l` option provides a detailed listing, and the `-a` option includes hidden files (those starting with a dot). Look for `script.sh` in the output.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Correct Directory

If `script.sh` is not in the current directory, you need to navigate to the directory where it resides. Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:

```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path where `script.sh` is located.

### Step 4: Verify the Filename

Ensure that the filename is spelled correctly and matches the case. Filenames are case-sensitive in Unix-like systems.

### Step 5: Create the Script if Missing

If `script.sh` does not exist, you can create it. Open a text editor like `nano`:

```bash
nano script.sh
```

Add the following content to the file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script commands here
echo "Hello, World!"
```

Save the file and exit the editor (in `nano`, press `CTRL+X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).

### Step 6: Set Executable Permissions

Make sure the script has executable permissions:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

### Step 7: Run the Script

Now, try running the script again:

### Additional Tips

- **Hidden Files**: If `script.sh` is a hidden file (i.e., it starts with a dot), you can list hidden files using:

  ```bash
  ls -la
  ```

- **Alternative Paths**: If you know the full path to `script.sh`, you can run it directly using the full path:

  ```bash
  /full/path/to/script.sh
  ```

- **Check for Typos**: Double-check the filename for any typos, including spaces or special characters.

If you follow these steps and still encounter issues, please provide more details about your environment and the exact commands you are running.

Given the observation that `bash: ./script.sh: No such file or directory`, it seems like the file `script.sh` is indeed not found in the current directory. Let's go through a step-by-step process to diagnose and resolve this issue.

### Step 1: Verify the Current Directory

First, confirm the current working directory by running:

```bash
pwd
```

This command will display the absolute path of the directory you are currently in.

### Step 2: List Files in the Current Directory

Next, list all files in the current directory to see if `script.sh` is present:

```bash
ls -la
```

The `-l` option provides a detailed listing, and the `-a` option includes hidden files (those starting with a dot). Look for `script.sh` in the output.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Correct Directory

If `script.sh` is not in the current directory, you need to navigate to the directory where it resides. Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:

```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path where `script.sh` is located.

### Step 4: Verify the Filename

Ensure that the filename is spelled correctly and matches the case. Filenames are case-sensitive in Unix-like systems.

### Step 5: Create the Script if Missing

If `script.sh` does not exist, you can create it. Open a text editor like `nano`:

```bash
nano script.sh
```

Add the following content to the file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script commands here
echo "Hello, World!"
```

Save the file and exit the editor (in `nano`, press `CTRL+X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).

### Step 6: Set Executable Permissions

Make sure the script has executable permissions:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

### Step 7: Run the Script

Now, try running the script again:

### Additional Tips

- **Hidden Files**: If `script.sh` is a hidden file (i.e., it starts with a dot), you can list hidden files using:

  ```bash
  ls -la
  ```

- **Alternative Paths**: If you know the full path to `script.sh`, you can run it directly using the full path:

  ```bash
  /full/path/to/script.sh
  ```

- **Check for Typos**: Double-check the filename for any typos, including spaces or special characters.

If you follow these steps and still encounter issues, please provide more details about your environment and the exact commands you are running.

It seems like you're encountering a series of "command not found" errors in your bash shell. This typically happens when the shell is trying to execute lines that are not valid commands or scripts. Let's break down the issue and find a solution.

### Step 1: Understand the Error

The errors indicate that the shell is interpreting each line as a separate command, which is incorrect. This could be due to a few reasons:

1. **Incorrect Script Format**: The script might be missing shebang (`#!/bin/bash`) at the top, or it might be formatted incorrectly.
2. **Environment Issues**: There might be issues with the environment variables or the shell configuration.
3. **File Permissions**: The file might not have executable permissions.

### Step 2: Check the Script

Let's assume you have a script named `script.sh`. Here’s how you can check and fix it:

1. **Add Shebang**: Ensure the script starts with `#!/bin/bash`.
2. **Check for Syntax Errors**: Make sure there are no syntax errors in the script.
3. **Set Executable Permissions**: Ensure the script has executable permissions.

### Step 3: Fix the Script

Here’s an example of how you can fix the script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script commands here
echo "Hello, World!"
```

### Step 4: Set Executable Permissions

Run the following command to set the executable permissions for the script:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

### Step 5: Run the Script

Now, try running the script:

### Step 6: Verify the Output

If everything is correct, you should see the output of your script. If you still encounter errors, please provide more details about the script and the environment.

### Additional Tips

- **Check for Hidden Characters**: Sometimes, hidden characters (like carriage returns) can cause issues. You can use `cat -v` to view hidden characters in the script.
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure that all necessary environment variables are set correctly.
- **Shell Configuration**: Check your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile` for any configurations that might be affecting the script execution.

If you provide more details about the script and the environment, I can offer more specific advice.

The error message "bash: ./script.sh: No such file or directory" indicates that the shell cannot find the file `script.sh` in the current directory. This could be due to several reasons:

1. **File Does Not Exist**: The file `script.sh` might not be present in the directory where you are trying to run it.
2. **Typographical Error**: There might be a typo in the filename.
3. **Directory Issue**: You might be in the wrong directory.

Let's go through the steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue.

### Step 1: Verify the File Exists

First, check if the file `script.sh` exists in the current directory:

```bash
ls -l
```

This command will list all files in the current directory along with their details. Look for `script.sh` in the output.

### Step 2: Check the Current Directory

Ensure you are in the correct directory where `script.sh` is located. You can print the current directory using:

```bash
pwd
```

If you are not in the correct directory, navigate to the correct one using:

```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path where `script.sh` is located.

### Step 3: Verify the Filename

Double-check the filename for any typos. Filenames are case-sensitive, so ensure the case matches exactly.

### Step 4: Create the File if Missing

If the file does not exist, you can create it using a text editor. For example, using `nano`:

```bash
nano script.sh
```

Add the following content to the file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script commands here
echo "Hello, World!"
```

Save the file and exit the editor (in `nano`, press `CTRL+X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).

### Step 5: Set Executable Permissions

Make sure the script has executable permissions:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

### Step 6: Run the Script

Now, try running the script again:

### Additional Tips

- **Hidden Files**: If `script.sh` is a hidden file (i.e., it starts with a dot), you can list hidden files using:

  ```bash
  ls -la
  ```

- **Alternative Paths**: If you know the full path to `script.sh`, you can run it directly using the full path:

  ```bash
  /full/path/to/script.sh
  ```

If you follow these steps and still encounter issues, please provide more details about your environment and the exact commands you are running.

### Step 2: List Files in the Current Directory

Next, list all files in the current directory to see if `script.sh` is present:

```bash
ls -la
```

The `-l` option provides a detailed listing, and the `-a` option includes hidden files (those starting with a dot). Look for `script.sh` in the output.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Correct Directory

If `script.sh` is not in the current directory, you need to navigate to the directory where it resides. Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:

```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path where `script.sh` is located.

### Step 4: Verify the Filename

Ensure that the filename is spelled correctly and matches the case. Filenames are case-sensitive in Unix-like systems.

### Step 5: Create the Script if Missing

If `script.sh` does not exist, you can create it. Open a text editor like `nano`:

```bash
nano script.sh
```

Add the following content to the file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script commands here
echo "Hello, World!"
```

Save the file and exit the editor (in `nano`, press `CTRL+X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).

### Step 6: Set Executable Permissions

Make sure the script has executable permissions:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

### Step 7: Run the Script

Now, try running the script again:

### Additional Tips

- **Hidden Files**: If `script.sh` is a hidden file (i.e., it starts with a dot), you can list hidden files using:

  ```bash
  ls -la
  ```

- **Alternative Paths**: If you know the full path to `script.sh`, you can run it directly using the full path:

  ```bash
  /full/path/to/script.sh
  ```

- **Check for Typos**: Double-check the filename for any typos, including spaces or special characters.

If you follow these steps and still encounter issues, please provide more details about your environment and the exact commands you are running.

Given the observation that `bash: ./script.sh: No such file or directory`, it seems like the file `script.sh` is indeed not found in the current directory. Let's go through a step-by-step process to diagnose and resolve this issue.

### Step 1: Verify the Current Directory

First, confirm the current working directory by running:

```bash
pwd
```

This command will display the absolute path of the directory you are currently in.

### Step 2: List Files in the Current Directory

Next, list all files in the current directory to see if `script.sh` is present:

```bash
ls -la
```

The `-l` option provides a detailed listing, and the `-a` option includes hidden files (those starting with a dot). Look for `script.sh` in the output.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Correct Directory

If `script.sh` is not in the current directory, you need to navigate to the directory where it resides. Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:

```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path where `script.sh` is located.

### Step 4: Verify the Filename

Ensure that the filename is spelled correctly and matches the case. Filenames are case-sensitive in Unix-like systems.

### Step 5: Create the Script if Missing

If `script.sh` does not exist, you can create it. Open a text editor like `nano`:

```bash
nano script.sh
```

Add the following content to the file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script commands here
echo "Hello, World!"
```

Save the file and exit the editor (in `nano`, press `CTRL+X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).

### Step 6: Set Executable Permissions

Make sure the script has executable permissions:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

### Step 7: Run the Script

Now, try running the script again:

### Additional Tips

- **Hidden Files**: If `script.sh` is a hidden file (i.e., it starts with a dot), you can list hidden files using:

  ```bash

- **Alternative Paths**: If you know the full path to `script.sh`, you can run it directly using the full path:

- **Check for Typos**: Double-check the filename for any typos, including spaces or special characters.

Given the observation that `bash: ./script.sh: No such file or directory`, it seems like the file `script.sh` is indeed not found in the current directory. Let's go through a step-by-step process to diagnose and resolve this issue.

### Step 1: Verify the Current Directory

First, confirm the current working directory by running:

```bash
pwd
```

This command will display the absolute path of the directory you are currently in.

### Step 2: List Files in the Current Directory

Next, list all files in the current directory to see if `script.sh` is present:

```bash
ls -la
```

The `-l` option provides a detailed listing, and the `-a` option includes hidden files (those starting with a dot). Look for `script.sh` in the output.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Correct Directory

If `script.sh` is not in the current directory, you need to navigate to the directory where it resides. Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:

```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path where `script.sh` is located.

### Step 4: Verify the Filename

Ensure that the filename is spelled correctly and matches the case. Filenames are case-sensitive in Unix-like systems.

### Step 5: Create the Script if Missing

If `script.sh` does not exist, you can create it. Open a text editor like `nano`:

```bash
nano script.sh
```

Add the following content to the file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script commands here
echo "Hello, World!"
```

Save the file and exit the editor (in `nano`, press `CTRL+X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).

### Step 6: Set Executable Permissions

Make sure the script has executable permissions:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

### Step 7: Run the Script

Now, try running the script again:

### Additional Tips

- **Hidden Files**: If `script.sh` is a hidden file (i.e., it starts with a dot), you can list hidden files using:

  ```bash
  ls -la
  ```

- **Alternative Paths**: If you know the full path to `script.sh`, you can run it directly using the full path:

  ```bash
  /full/path/to/script.sh
  ```

- **Check for Typos**: Double-check the filename for any typos, including spaces or special characters.

If you follow these steps and still encounter issues, please provide more details about your environment and the exact commands you are running.

```bash
pwd
```

This command will display the absolute path of the directory you are currently in.

### Step 2: List Files in the Current Directory

Next, list all files in the current directory to see if `script.sh` is present:

```bash
ls -la
```

The `-l` option provides a detailed listing, and the `-a` option includes hidden files (those starting with a dot). Look for `script.sh` in the output.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Correct Directory

If `script.sh` is not in the current directory, you need to navigate to the directory where it resides. Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:

```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path where `script.sh` is located.

### Step 4: Verify the Filename

Ensure that the filename is spelled correctly and matches the case. Filenames are case-sensitive in Unix-like systems.

### Step 5: Create the Script if Missing

If `script.sh` does not exist, you can create it. Open a text editor like `nano`:

```bash
nano script.sh
```

Add the following content to the file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script commands here
echo "Hello, World!"
```

Save the file and exit the editor (in `nano`, press `CTRL+X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).

### Step 6: Set Executable Permissions

Make sure the script has executable permissions:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

### Step 7: Run the Script

Now, try running the script again:

### Additional Tips

- **Hidden Files**: If `script.sh` is a hidden file (i.e., it starts with a dot), you can list hidden files using:

  ```bash
  ls -la
  ```

- **Alternative Paths**: If you know the full path to `script.sh`, you can run it directly using the full path:

  ```bash
  /full/path/to/script.sh
  ```

- **Check for Typos**: Double-check the filename for any typos, including spaces or special characters.

If you follow these steps and still encounter issues, please provide more details about your environment and the exact commands you are running.

Given the observation that `bash: ./script.sh: No such file or directory`, it seems like the file `script.sh` is indeed not found in the current directory. Let's go through a step-by-step process to diagnose and resolve this issue.

### Step 1: Verify the Current Directory

First, confirm the current working directory by running:

```bash
pwd
```

This command will display the absolute path of the directory you are currently in.

### Step 2: List Files in the Current Directory

Next, list all files in the current directory to see if `script.sh` is present:

```bash
ls -la
```

The `-l` option provides a detailed listing, and the `-a` option includes hidden files (those starting with a dot). Look for `script.sh` in the output.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Correct Directory

If `script.sh` is not in the current directory, you need to navigate to the directory where it resides. Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:

```bash
cd /path/to/directory
```

Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path where `script.sh` is located.

### Step 4: Verify the Filename

Ensure that the filename is spelled correctly and matches the case. Filenames are case-sensitive in Unix-like systems.

### Step 5: Create the Script if Missing

If `script.sh` does not exist, you can create it. Open a text editor like `nano`:

```bash
nano script.sh
```

Add the following content to the file:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Your script commands here
echo "Hello, World!"
```

Save the file and exit the editor (in `nano`, press `CTRL+X`, then `Y`, and `Enter`).

### Step 6: Set Executable Permissions

Make sure the script has executable permissions:

```bash
chmod +x script.sh
```

### Step 7: Run the Script

Now, try running the script again:

### Additional Tips

- **Hidden Files**: If `script.sh` is a hidden file (i.e., it starts with a dot), you can list hidden files using:

  ```bash
  ls -la
  ```

- **Alternative Paths**: If you know the full path to `script.sh`, you can run it directly using the full path:

  ```bash
  /full/path/to/script.sh
  ```

- **Check for Typos**: Double-check the filename for any typos, including spaces or special characters.

If you follow these steps and still encounter issues, please provide more details about your environment and the exact commands you are running.

Given the observation that `bash: ./script.sh: No such file or directory`, it seems like the file `script.sh` is indeed not found in the current directory. Let's go through a step-by-step process to diagnose and resolve this issue.

### Step 1: Verify the Current Directory

First, confirm the current working directory by running:

```bash
pwd
```

This command will display the absolute path of the directory you are currently in.

### Step 2: List Files in the Current Directory

Next, list all files in the current directory to see if `script.sh` is present:

```bash
ls -la
```

The `-l` option provides a detailed listing, and the `-a` option includes hidden files (those starting with a dot). Look for `script.sh` in the output.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Correct Directory

If `script.sh` is not in the current directory, you need to navigate to the directory where it resides. Use the `cd` command to change directories. For example:

Replace `/path/to/directory` with the actual path where `script.sh` is located.

### Step 4: Verify the Filename

Ensure that the filename is spelled correctly and matches

cd /path/to/directory
